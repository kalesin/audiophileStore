# Audiophile E-commerce Store
The store is written in Vue.js on the front-end, using Postgres, Express and Node.js on the backend.

# Features
The store has all the components of an commercial e-commerce site. The front-end design was dictated by the design specifications given in the Frontend mentor project.
The original project's scope was only the website design and basic cart and checkout functionality. 

I expanded the store front to include some basic animations, checkout payments with Stripe, 
 and full login functionality(register, login, change password, reset password email, saving customer addresses etc.).
 For a secure experience I hash passwords and use JWT tokens for persistent user sessions. 
 
# Usage
If you wish to test the Stripe payments integration, please use the card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, combined with any future date of expiry and any CVC code.
